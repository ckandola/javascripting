when using for-in statements, you may want to filter out functions and
prototype properties you don't want:
    var name;
    for(name in cat){
        if(typeof cat[name] !== 'function'){
            document.writeln(name + ': ' + cat[name]);
        }
    }

    don't use this if you want to display properties in a specific
    order

delete operator can be used to remove a property from an object. It
won't touch any of the objects in the prototype linkage. If there
is a property in the prototype linkage, then the deletion will
reveal that property instead.

Avoid use of global vars w/ single global var:
    var myApp = {}; // container for application
